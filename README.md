# Distributed Matrix Multiplication (Simulated with Hazelcast and Multiprocessing)

This project performs distributed-style matrix multiplication using:

- âœ… `multiprocessing` to simulate parallel computation (multiple nodes)
- âœ… `Hazelcast` distributed map for shared storage (Matrix A, B, and result)
- âœ… Logging of performance metrics to a CSV file for analysis (memory, CPU, execution time)
